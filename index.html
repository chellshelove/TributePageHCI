<h2> Legacy </h2> 
    <p> <ul>
        <li>When ‘Caged Bird’ was published, Angelou was </li>
        <li>hailed as a new kind of memoirist, and was placed </li>
        <li>in the tradition of African-American literature as a </li>
        <li>defense of Black culture. Her poem, encouraged </li>
        <li>Black feminist writings in the 1970s to "open </li>
        <li>themselves up without shame to the eyes of the </li>
        <li>world." Now, Angelou's poetry has influenced the </li>
        <li>modern hip-hop music community, including artists </li>
        <li>such as Kanye West, Tupac Shakur, and </li>
        <li>Nicki Minaj.</li>
